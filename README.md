# IoT-Solar-Tracking-System

A system that positions the solar plate at an angle relative to the Sun for more energy production than regular setup.

- Developed and implemented a solar tracking system using Arduino UNO to optimize energy generation efficiency.
- Integrated light sensors to detect sunlight intensity and direction, enabling precise control of motorized solar panel orientation.
